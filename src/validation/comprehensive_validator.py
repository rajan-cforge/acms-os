Comprehensive Validation on 100K Memories

Production-grade validation suite with 7 dimensions:
1. Statistical validation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
2. Edge case detection (6 categories)
3. Performance validation (latency, concurrency)
4. Quality analysis (duplicates, topics, privacy)
5. Confidence distribution analysis
6. Threshold optimization
7. Failure pattern analysis
